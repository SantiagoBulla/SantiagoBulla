👋 Hello! I'm @SantiagoBulla, a passionate software developer and web enthusiast with a knack for learning and exploring new technologies.

👨‍💻 Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of software development, focusing on both web and mobile technologies. I have experience working with a variety of tools and languages, including React, Flutter, JavaScript, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Node.js.

📱 Although my primary expertise lies in web development, I also dabble in mobile development and have a solid understanding of mobile frameworks like Flutter.

📘 When I'm not coding, you can often find me buried in a good book, expanding my knowledge and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in technology.

⚙️ Additionally, I have some experience in quality assurance (QA) testing using Java, Selenium, Cucumber, and Gherkin, which adds an extra layer of expertise to my skill set.

🌟 I'm always eager to collaborate on interesting projects and expand my horizons in the ever-evolving field of software development. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
